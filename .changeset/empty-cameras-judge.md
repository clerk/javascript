Refined German (de-DE) waitlist localization for improved clarity and consistency

This update improves the waitlist flow by:
- Updating action link text from “Jetzt anmelden” to “Anmelden”
- Changing action text from “Kein Zugang? Auf die Warteliste setzen!” to “Bereits Zugang?”
- Adjusting form button label from “Zur Warteliste hinzufügen” to “Warteliste beitreten”
- Clarifying the waitlist start subtitle with instructions to enter an email for notifications
- Aligning success subtitles with consistent wording for availability notifications

The German waitlist localization now offers clearer guidance and a smoother user experience.
