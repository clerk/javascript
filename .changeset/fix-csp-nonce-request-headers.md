'@clerk/nextjs': patch
---

Fixed an issue where the CSP nonce generated by `clerkMiddleware({ contentSecurityPolicy: { strict: true } })` was not forwarded as a request header. Server components can now access the nonce via `headers()`, allowing `ClerkProvider` and Next.js to apply it to `<script>` tags.
