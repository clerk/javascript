## Optimize handshake payload delivery with nonce-based fetching

This change introduces a significant optimization to the handshake flow by replacing direct payload delivery with a nonce-based approach to overcome browser cookie size limitations.

## Problem Solved
Previously, the handshake payload (an encoded JWT containing set-cookie headers) was sent directly in a cookie. Since browsers limit cookies to ~4KB, this severely restricted the practical size of session tokens, which are also JWTs stored in cookies but embedded within the handshake payload.

## Solution 
We now use a conditional approach based on payload size:
- **Small payloads (≤2KB)**: Continue using the direct approach for optimal performance
- **Large payloads (>2KB)**: Use nonce-based fetching to avoid cookie size limits

For large payloads, we:
1. Generate a short nonce (ID) for each handshake instance
2. Send only the nonce in the `__clerk_handshake_nonce` cookie
3. Use the nonce to fetch the actual handshake payload via a dedicated BAPI endpoint

## New Handshake Flow (for payloads >2KB)
1. User visits `example.com`
2. Client app middleware triggers handshake → `307 FAPI/v1/client/handshake`
3. FAPI handshake resolves → `307 example.com` with `__clerk_handshake_nonce` cookie containing the nonce
4. Client app middleware makes `GET BAPI/v1/clients/handshake_payload?nonce=<nonce_value>` request (BAPI)
5. BAPI returns array of set-cookie header values
6. Client app middleware applies headers to the response

## Traditional Flow (for payloads ≤2KB)
No changes. Continues to work as before with direct payload delivery in cookies for optimal performance.

## Trade-offs
- **Added**: One additional BAPI call per handshake (only for payloads >2KB)
- **Removed**: Cookie size restrictions that previously limited session token size
