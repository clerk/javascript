Introduce @clerk/agent-toolkit package. The Clerk Agent Toolkit enables popular agent frameworks, including Vercel's AI SDK and LangChain, to integrate with Clerk using tools (also known as function calling).

This package exposes a subset of Clerk's functionality to agent frameworks, allowing you to build powerful agentic systems capable of managing users, user data, organizations, and more.

**Please note:** All relevant information and instructions on how to set it up can be found in the package's README. It's an early developer preview and can't be considered stable yet.
