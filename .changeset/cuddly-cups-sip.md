'@clerk/tanstack-start': patch
---

Added a warning message to inform users that the package has been renamed from `@clerk/tanstack-start` to `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`. This change aligns our package naming with TanStack Start's conventions. Users should update their dependencies to use the new package name, as this is the last release under the old name.
