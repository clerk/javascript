### Future improvements

- Applications can be setup once and reused across tests and browsers. We can create a new project called "setup" that builds some predefined apps. Since each test gets its own context, these apps can be started once and reused across all browsers and tests, as long as their files do not change. We can tag these tests using @predefinedApp so we can run them all as part of a single project.
