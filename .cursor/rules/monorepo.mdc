Monorepo Architecture and Structure

Repository Overview
- This is the official Clerk JavaScript SDK monorepo containing all Clerk authentication packages
- Clerk provides streamlined user experiences for sign up, sign in, and profile management
- All packages are published under the @clerk namespace on npm
- Uses pnpm as the package manager with Turbo for build orchestration
- Supports multiple JavaScript frameworks and environments

Core Package Categories
- **Core SDK**: `@clerk/clerk-js` - Core browser SDK with UI components
- **Framework Integrations**: Next.js, React, Vue, Astro, Nuxt, Remix, Express, Fastify
- **Platform Support**: Expo (React Native), Chrome Extension
- **Backend**: `@clerk/backend` - Server-side utilities and JWT verification
- **Shared Utilities**: `@clerk/shared`, `@clerk/types` - Common utilities and TypeScript types
- **Developer Tools**: `@clerk/testing`, `@clerk/dev-cli`, `@clerk/upgrade`
- **UI Libraries**: `@clerk/elements` - Unstyled UI primitives, `@clerk/themes` - Pre-built themes
- **Specialized**: `@clerk/agent-toolkit` - AI agent integration tools

Directory Structure
- `packages/` - All publishable packages
- `integration/` - End-to-end tests and integration templates
- `playground/` - Development and testing applications
- `docs/` - Documentation and contribution guides
- `scripts/` - Build and automation scripts
- `tools/` - Internal development tools

Development Workflow
- Use `pnpm dev` to start development mode for all packages
- Use `pnpm build` to build all packages
- Use `pnpm test` to run unit tests across all packages
- Use `pnpm test:integration:*` for framework-specific integration tests
- Turbo handles caching and dependency orchestration
- Changesets for version management and release automation

Framework-Specific Packages
- `@clerk/nextjs` - Next.js App Router and Pages Router support
- `@clerk/clerk-react` - React hooks and components
- `@clerk/vue` - Vue.js composables and components
- `@clerk/astro` - Astro integration with SSR support
- `@clerk/nuxt` - Nuxt.js module
- `@clerk/remix` - Remix loader and action utilities
- `@clerk/express` - Express.js middleware
- `@clerk/fastify` - Fastify plugin
- `@clerk/expo` - React Native/Expo SDK

Testing Architecture
- Unit tests with Jest and Vitest
- Integration tests with Playwright
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests across multiple framework templates
- Visual regression testing for UI components
- Separate test configurations per framework

Build System
- Turbo for monorepo orchestration and caching
- tsup for TypeScript compilation and bundling
- ESLint with custom configurations for different package types
- Prettier for code formatting
- Bundle size monitoring with bundlewatch
- Type checking with TypeScript and publint

Environment Configuration
- Supports multiple Clerk environment variables (CLERK_*, NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_*, etc.)
- Development, staging, and production configurations
- Verdaccio for local npm registry testing
- Docker support for integration testing
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Localization Support
- `packages/localizations/` contains translations for 30+ languages
- Modular localization system allowing partial imports
- Support for RTL languages
- Framework-agnostic translation utilities

Package Interdependency Rules
- `@clerk/shared` is a common dependency for most packages
- `@clerk/types` provides TypeScript definitions used across packages
- `@clerk/backend` is independent and used for server-side operations
- Framework packages depend on `@clerk/clerk-js` for core functionality
- Integration packages build upon framework-specific packages

Release Management
- Automated releases with Changesets
- Semantic versioning across all packages
- Canary and snapshot releases for testing
- Git tags and GitHub releases for version tracking
- Coordinated releases to maintain compatibility between packages
