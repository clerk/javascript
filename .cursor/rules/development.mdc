Development Practices and Tooling

Development Environment Setup
- Requires Node.js 18.17.0+ and pnpm 9.15.9+
- Use `pnpm install` to install all dependencies
- Environment variables should be set in appropriate `.env` files
- Use `pnpm dev` to start development mode across all packages

Monorepo Development Workflow
- Make changes in the relevant package under `/packages/`
- Use `pnpm dev` to watch for changes and rebuild automatically
- Test changes using playground applications in `/playground/`
- Run specific package commands using pnpm workspace syntax: `pnpm --filter @clerk/nextjs build`
- Use Turbo for efficient builds: `turbo build --filter=@clerk/nextjs`

Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass ESLint checks with the project's configuration
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
- TypeScript is required for all packages
- Follow established naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables)
- Maintain comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs

Testing Requirements
- Unit tests are required for all new functionality
- Use Jest for unit testing, Vitest for some packages
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Integration tests using Playwright for E2E scenarios
- Test files should be co-located with source files or in `__tests__` directories
- Maintain test coverage above established thresholds

Package Development Guidelines
- Each package should have a clear single responsibility
- Follow semantic versioning for all packages
- Use Changesets for version management and changelogs
- Packages should export TypeScript types alongside runtime code
- Use tsup for building packages with proper ESM/CJS dual publishing

Framework Integration Patterns
- Framework packages should provide idiomatic APIs for their respective frameworks
- Maintain consistency in naming and patterns across framework integrations
- Provide both high-level components and low-level utilities
- Ensure SSR/SSG compatibility where applicable
- Follow framework-specific best practices and conventions

API Design Principles
- Design APIs to be intuitive and self-documenting
- Provide sensible defaults to minimize configuration
- Support both imperative and declarative usage patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Use progressive enhancement for advanced features

Build and Bundle Optimization
- Use tree-shaking friendly exports
- Minimize bundle sizes through careful dependency management
- Use dynamic imports for optional features
- Monitor bundle sizes with bundlewatch
- Optimize for both development and production builds

Documentation Standards
- All public APIs must be documented with JSDoc
- Provide usage examples in documentation
- Maintain up-to-date README files for each package
- Use TypeDoc for generating API documentation
- Include migration guides for breaking changes

Error Handling Patterns
- Use proper TypeScript error types
- Provide meaningful error messages to developers
- Include error recovery suggestions where applicable
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Use error boundaries in React components

Performance Considerations
- Lazy load components and features when possible
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Minimize re-renders in React components
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Profile and optimize critical paths

Security Guidelines
- Never commit sensitive keys or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Regular security audits of dependencies

Debugging and Development Tools
- Use browser dev tools for client-side debugging
- Implement proper logging with different levels
- Use Clerk's development dashboard for testing
- Leverage source maps for debugging built code
- Use performance profiling tools when needed

Integration Testing Approach
- Each framework integration has its own test suite
- Use real Clerk instances for integration tests
- Test authentication flows end-to-end
- Verify proper error handling and edge cases
- Test across different browsers and environments

Release Process
- Use Changesets for managing releases
- Follow semantic versioning strictly
- Coordinate releases across dependent packages
- Test releases in staging environments
- Maintain detailed changelogs

Local Development Tips
- Use playground applications to test changes quickly
- Set up multiple test environments for different scenarios
- Use pkglab for local npm registry testing (`pkglab pub` to publish, `pkglab add` to install)
- Leverage hot reloading for faster development cycles
- Use proper IDE setup with TypeScript support

Contribution Guidelines
- Follow the established PR template
- Include tests for all new features
- Update documentation for API changes
- Ensure all CI checks pass before merging
- Get proper code review from team members

Package Maintenance
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Deprecate features properly with migration paths
- Maintain compatibility matrices for supported versions
- Archive packages that are no longer maintained
