# Clerk Chrome Extension Starter

This starter project shows how to use [Clerk](https://www.clerk.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=starter_repos&utm_campaign=chrome_extension_start) authentication in a React based [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/).

## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [CRXJ](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/).

It's a kitchen-sink starter of how to use ClerkJS in a Chrome Extension either as a Standalone App or alongside a Web Application via WebSSO.

It demonstrates a basic password or OTP flow using ClerkJS Components in the following extension contexts:

- [x] Popup `action.*`
- [x] Chrome Pages
  - [x] New Tab `chrome_url_overrides.newtab`
  - [x] History `chrome_url_overrides.history`
  - [x] Bookmark Manager `chrome_url_overrides.bookmarks`
- [x] Dev Tools `devtools_page`
- [x] Extension Options `options_ui`

You may safely remove any of the above contexts from the `manifest.json` if you do not need them.

This repo will be enhanced with examples of authentication redirection flows such as OAuth or Magic Links and advanced extension patterns.

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for a Clerk account at [https://clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?utm_source=github&utm_medium=template_repos&utm_campaign=chrome_extension_template).
2. Go to the [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=template_repos&utm_campaign=chrome_extension_template) and create an application.
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-chrome-extension-starter.git clerk-chrome-extension-starter`
4. Go to the project directory: cd clerk-chrome-extension-starter
5. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Copy example files and sent the required variables in each file:
   - `cp .env.example .env`
   - `cp manifest.json.example manifest.json`
   - `cp manifest.dev.json.example manifest.dev.json` (The attributes in this file overwrite the attributes in `manifest.json` when running in development mode.)
7. Launch the development server: `npm run dev`

The files generated in the `dist` directory can be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

PLEASE NOTE: Any changes to the manifest require a reload of the extension in [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
