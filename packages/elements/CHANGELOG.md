## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`d6b5006c4`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/d6b5006c4cc1b6f07bb3a6832b4ec6e65ea15814)]:
  - @clerk/types@4.7.0

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a development-only warning for cases when a user renders a `<Strategy>` component that isn't activated for their Clerk instance. As this can be intended behavior (e.g. build out a full example and let user enable/disable stuff solely in the dashboard) the warning can safely be ignored if necessary. ([#3609](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3609)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Improve `<FieldState>` and re-organize some data attributes related to validity states. These changes might be breaking changes for you. ([#3594](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3594)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  Overview of changes:

  - `<form>` no longer has `data-valid` and `data-invalid` attributes. If there are global errors (same heuristics as `<GlobalError>`) then a `data-global-error` attribute will be present.
  - Fixed a bug where `<Field>` could contain `data-valid` and `data-invalid` at the same time.
  - The field state (accessible through e.g. `<FieldState>`) now also incorporates the field's [ValidityState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) into its output. If the `ValidityState` is invalid, the field state will be an `error`. You can access this information in three places:
    1. `<FieldState>`
    2. `data-state` attribute on `<Input>`
    3. `<Field>{(state) => <p>Field's state is {state}</p>}</Field>`

### Patch Changes

- Fix Sign In & Sign Up root fallbacks not rendering as expected ([#3601](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3601)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

- Update all Radix dependencies to their June 19, 2024 release ([#3606](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3606)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- The `path` prop on the `<SignIn.Root>` and `<SignUp.Root>` component is now automatically inferred. Previously, the default values were `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`, on other routes you had to explicitly define your route. ([#3557](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3557)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  The new heuristic for determining the path where `<SignIn.Root>` and `<SignUp.Root>` are mounted is:

  1. `path` prop
  2. Automatically inferred
  3. If it can't be inferred, fallback to `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` and `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` env var
  4. Fallback to `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`

### Patch Changes

- Render the resendable button at the 0 tick ([#3575](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3575)) by [@alexcarpenter](https://github.com/alexcarpenter)

- Updated dependencies [[`1273b04ec`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/1273b04ecf1866b59ef59a74abe31dbcc726da2c)]:
  - @clerk/types@4.6.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Support passkeys in `<SignIn>` flows. ([#3472](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3472)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  APIs introduced:

  - `<SignIn.Passkey />`
  - `<SignIn.SupportedStrategy name='passkey'>`
  - `<SignIn.Strategy name='passkey'>`
  - Detects the usage of `webauthn` to trigger passkey autofill `<Clerk.Input autoComplete="webauthn" />`

  Usage examples:

  - `<SignIn.Action passkey />`

    ```tsx
    <SignIn.Step name="start">
      <SignIn.Passkey>
        <Clerk.Loading>
          {(isLoading) => (isLoading ? <Spinner /> : "Use passkey instead")}.
        </Clerk.Loading>
      </SignIn.Passkey>
    </SignIn.Step>
    ```

  - `<SignIn.SupportedStrategy name='passkey'>`

    ```tsx
    <SignIn.SupportedStrategy asChild name="passkey">
      <Button>use passkey</Button>
    </SignIn.SupportedStrategy>
    ```

  - `<SignIn.Strategy name='passkey'>`

    ```tsx
    <SignIn.Strategy name="passkey">
      <p className="text-sm">
        Welcome back <SignIn.Salutation />!
      </p>

      <CustomSubmit>Continue with Passkey</CustomSubmit>
    </SignIn.Strategy>
    ```

  - Passkey Autofill
    ```tsx
    <SignIn.Step name="start">
      <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
        <Clerk.Label className="sr-only">Email</Clerk.Label>
        <Clerk.Input
          autoComplete="webauthn"
          placeholder="Enter your email address"
        />
        <Clerk.FieldError />
      </Clerk.Field>
    </SignIn.Step>
    ```

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`73e5d61e2`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/73e5d61e21ab3f77f3c8343bc63da0626466c7ac), [`b8e46328d`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/b8e46328da874859c4928f19f924219cd6520b11)]:
  - @clerk/types@4.6.0

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Widen optional peerDependency of `next` to include `>=15.0.0-rc`. This way you can use Next.js 15 with Clerk Elements without your package manager complaining. Also allow React 19. ([#3445](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3445)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Update the TypeScript type of `<Input />` to allow the `validatePassword` prop also on `type="text"` (in addition to `type="password"`) ([#3394](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3394)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- - Adds Stately's Browser Inspector in development builds ([#3424](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3424)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

  - Removes `@statelyai/inspect` from dependencies
  - Ensures all inspector-related code is omitted from the build

### Patch Changes

- Fix: Verification form submission wasn't working after returning from "choosing an alternate strategy" without making a selection. ([#3425](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3425)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

  Perf: Adds a `NeverRetriable` state for applicable strategies so the countdown doesn't run needlessly.

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- Update FieldError/GlobalError types to allow render function children while using the asChild prop ([#3426](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3426)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

## 0.4.6

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- Update `<FieldError />` to enable `asChild` prop for custom markup in render function usage. ([#3396](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3396)) by [@alexcarpenter](https://github.com/alexcarpenter)

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix `setActive` not firing upon a successful sign up. ([#3391](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3391)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix typing for GlobalError and FieldError render functions ([#3387](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3387)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

## 0.4.2

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- This release includes various smaller fixes and one dependency update: ([#3343](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3343)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

  - `xstate` was updated from `5.12.0` to `5.13.0`
  - Previously, the contents of the `fallback` prop were sometimes shown even if the user wasn't on the `start` step. This bug is fixed now.
  - Upon completion of an sign-in/sign-up attempt, don't immediately return to the `start` step. This fixes the issue of a "flash of content" that could e.g. be seen during sign-in with OAuth providers.
  - Some underlying fixes in Clerk Elements' XState logic were applied to make sure that during a sign-in/sign-up attempt the state is properly maintained. For example, if you visit an already completed attempt (some step of that flow) it now properly keeps track of that state.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- With this change `<SignIn.Step name="choose-strategy">` and `<SignIn.Step name="forgot-password">` now render a `<div>`. This aligns them with all other `<Step>` components (which render an element, mostly `<form>`). ([#3359](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3359)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  **Required action:** Update your markup to account for the new `<div>`, e.g. by removing an element you previously added yourself and moving props like `className` to the `<Step>` now. This change can be considered a breaking change so check if you're affected.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- The following are all internal changes and not relevant to any end-user: ([#3329](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3329)) by [@LauraBeatris](https://github.com/LauraBeatris)

  Create type interface for `TelemetryCollector` on `@clerk/types`. This allows to assign `telemetry` on the main Clerk SDK object, while inheriting from the actual `TelemetryCollector` implementation.

- Refactors internal logic to avoid reliance on `useEffect`. This resolves potential for race conditions as a result of functionality coupled to component renders. ([#3320](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3320)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)
