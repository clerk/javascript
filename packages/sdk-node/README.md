## Overview

[Clerk](https://clerk.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_sdk_node) is the easiest way to add authentication and user management to your Node.js application. To gain a better understanding of the Clerk Backend API and SDK, refer to
the <a href="https://clerk.com/docs/reference/node/getting-started?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_sdk_node" target="_blank">Node SDK</a> and <a href="https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api" target="_blank">Backend API</a> documentation.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+

## Installation

```sh
npm install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```

To build the package locally with the TypeScript compiler, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Usage

Retrieve your Backend API key from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) screen in your Clerk dashboard and set it as an environment variable in a `.env` file:

```sh
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_*******
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_******
```

You will then be able to access all the available methods.

```js
import 'dotenv/config'; // To read CLERK_SECRET_KEY
import clerk from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

const userList = await clerk.users.getUserList();
```
