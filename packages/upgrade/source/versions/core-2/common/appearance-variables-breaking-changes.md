Several appearance variables have been removed or renamed. If you were using these variables in your application, you will need to update your code to use the new variables.

- The \`fontSmoothing\` variable has been removed.
- The \`shadowShimmer\` variable has been removed.
- The \`colorAlphaShade\` variable has been renamed to \`colorNeutral\`.
