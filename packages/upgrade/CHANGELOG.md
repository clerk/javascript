  @clerk/upgrade: Adding required codemod for @clerk/nextjs breaking changes

  # Migration guide

  ## `auth()` is now async

  Previously the `auth()` method from `@clerk/nextjs/server` was synchronous.

  ```typescript
  import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

  export function GET() {
    const { userId } = auth();
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ userId }));
  }
  ```

  The `auth` method now becomes asynchronous. You will need to make the following changes to the snippet above to make it compatible.

  ```diff
  - export function GET() {
  + export async function GET() {
  -   const { userId } = auth();
  +   const { userId } = await auth();
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ userId }));
  }
  ```

  ## Clerk middleware auth is now async

  ```typescript
  import { clerkClient, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
    const resolvedAuth = await auth();

    const count = await resolvedAuth.users.getCount();

    if (count) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-url', request.url));
    }
  });

  export const config = {
    matcher: [...],
  };
  ```

  ## clerkClient() is now async

  Previously the `clerkClient()` method from `@clerk/nextjs/server` was synchronous.

  ```typescript
  import { clerkClient, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

  export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
    const client = clerkClient();

    const count = await client.users?.getCount();

    if (count) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-url', request.url));
    }
  });

  export const config = {
    matcher: [...],
  };
  ```

  The method now becomes async. You will need to make the following changes to the snippet above to make it compatible.

  ```diff
  - export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
  - const client = clerkClient();
  + export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
  + const client = await clerkClient();
    const count = await client.users?.getCount();

    if (count) {
  }
  ```
