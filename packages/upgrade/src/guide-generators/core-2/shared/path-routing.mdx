### Path routing is now the default

On components like [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) you can define the props `routing` and `path`. `routing` can be set to `'hash' | 'path' | 'virtual'` and describes the routing strategy that should be used. `path` defines where the component is mounted when `routing="path"` is used.

In the latest version, the **default** `routing` strategy has become `'path'`. Unless you change the `routing` prop, you'll need to define the `path` prop. The affected components are:

- `<SignIn />`
- `<SignUp />`
- `<UserProfile />`
- `<CreateOrganization />`
- `<OrganizationProfile />`

Here's how you'd use the components going forward:

```jsx
<SignIn path="/sign-in" />
<SignUp path="/sign-up" />
<UserProfile path="/user-profile" />
<CreateOrganization path="/create-org" />
<OrganizationProfile path="/org-profile" />
```

If you don't define the `path` prop an error will be thrown. Of course, you can still use `routing="hash"` or `routing="virtual"`.

```jsx
<UserProfile routing="hash" />
<OrganizationProfile routing="virtual" />
```

<% if (['@clerk/nextjs', '@clerk/remix'].includes(packageName)) { %>
For the <%= packageName %> SDK, you can set environment variables for the sign up/in URLs and avoid needing to explicitly pass the path to the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components.

<% if (packageName === '@clerk/nextjs') { %>

```env filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

<% } %>
<% if (packageName === '@clerk/remix') { %>

```env filename=".env"
CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

<% } %>

If you have defined both environment variables, you're able to use the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components without any props, as such:

```jsx
<SignIn />
<SignUp />
```

<% } %>
