**Updating React**

All react-dependent Clerk SDKs now require you to use React 18 or higher. You can update your project by installing the latest version of `react` and `react-dom`.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm add react@latest react-dom@latest
    ```

</CodeBlockTabs>
