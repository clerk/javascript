### Removed: `orgs` claim on JWT

In the previous version of Clerk's SDKs, if you decode the session token that Clerk returns from the server, you'll currently find an `orgs` claim on it. It lists all the orgs associated with the given user. Now, Clerk returns the `org_id`, `org_slug`, and `org_role` of the **active** organization.

The `orgs` claim was part of the `JwtPayload`. Here are a few examples of where the `JwtPayload` could be found.

If you would like to have your JWT return all of the user's organizations, you can create a [custom JWT template](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates) in your dashboard. Add `{ "orgs": "user.organizations" }` to it.
