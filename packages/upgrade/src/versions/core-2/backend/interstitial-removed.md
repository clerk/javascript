title: '`interstitial` api removed'
matcher: "loadInterstitialFromLocal\\("

The interstitial has been replaced within Clerk internals entirely by a new mechanism called "handshake". If you were using the interstitial API in your logic, please reach out to [Clerk support](https://clerk.com/support) to connect with our team and discuss how to migrate your code to use the new handshake mechanism.
