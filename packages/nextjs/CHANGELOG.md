## 4.20.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for NextJS applications hosted on AWS Amplify by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- Tweaked the default `authMiddleware` behavior for protected API routes. An unauthenticated request for a protected API route will no longer return a `307 Redirect` - a `401 Unauthorized` response will be returned instead. by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  With this change, an API route is considered a request for which the following rules apply:

  - The request url matches the following patterns; `['/api/(.*)', '/trpc/(.*)']`
  - Or, the request has `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Or, the request method is not one of: `GET`, `OPTIONS` ,` HEAD`

  A new `apiRoutes` param has been introduced on `authMiddleware`. It can accept an array of path patterns, `RegexExp` or strings. If `apiRoutes` is passed in explicitly, then it overrides the behavior described above and only the requests matching `apiRoutes` will be considered as API routes requests.
  For more technical details, refer to the PR's description.

- Add support for NextJS applications hosted on Railway by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

### Patch Changes

- Improve debug logs in NextJS by adding AuthStatusObject.debug data by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- The devBrowser JWT is now added to all cross-origin redirects triggered by calling `redirectToSignIn` or `redirectToSignUp`. by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- Improve debug logging by including `AuthObject.debug()` data when `debug` is `true` in `authMiddleware` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- ESM/CJS support for `@clerk/clerk-react` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  Changes that should affect users and OS contributors:

  - Better source map support for `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared`. This affects anyone developing in our monorepo or anyone using a debugger with Clerk installed in their app.
  - Easier node_modules debugging as `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/nextjs` are no longer getting bundled as a single-file package. This also improves error logging in nextjs a lot, as nextjs usually logs the line that threw the error - a minified, single-file package, usually consists of a very long single-line module, so logging error in NextJS wasn't ideal.
  - Headless clerk-js bundle size reduced by ~10kb, normal clerk-ks by ~6kb
  - A new `clerkJSVersion` prop has been added on ClerkProvider allowing to fetch a specific clerk-js version.

- `authMiddleware` handles multi-domain relared properties passed as functions properly by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- Updated dependencies [[`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3)]:
