Clerk: The <${component}/> component is not configured correctly. The most likely reasons for this error are:

1. The "${path}" route is not a catch-all route.
It is recommended to convert this route to a catch-all route, eg: "${correctPath}". Alternatively, you can update the <${component}/> component to use hash-based routing by setting the "routing" prop to "hash".

2. The <${component}/> component is mounted in a catch-all route, but all routes under "${path}" are protected by the middleware.
To resolve this, ensure that the middleware does not protect the catch-all route or any of its children. If you are using the "createRouteMatcher" helper, consider adding "(.*)" to the end of the route pattern, eg: "${path}(.*)".
