However, for improved performance, these requests should be ignored using the default config.matcher API exported from your middleware file.
The request URL was: ${url}.

To resolve this warning, open your middleware file, set your config.matcher as shown below and restart your dev server:

export const config = {
  matcher: ${matcher},
};

If you intentionally want to run the authMiddleware for this route, you can exclude it from the default ignoredRoutes.
