/**
 * The `BillingSubscriptionItem` object is similar to the [`BillingSubscriptionItemResource`](/docs/references/javascript/types/commerce-subscription-item-resource) object as it holds information about a subscription item, as well as methods for managing it. However, the `BillingSubscriptionItem` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/commerce/get/commerce/subscription_items) and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
 *
 * @experimental This is an experimental API for the Billing feature that is available under a public beta, and the API is subject to change. It is advised to [pin](https://clerk.com/docs/pinning) the SDK version and the clerk-js version to avoid breaking changes.
