# Change Log

## 0.30.2

### Patch Changes

- Improve the `jwk-remote-missing` error by adding the available JWK IDs to the error message. This way you can understand why the entry was not found and compare the available ones with other keys. ([#1816](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/pull/1816)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

This fixes an issue when Clerk is used in applications that are deployed behind AWS CloudFront, where previously all requests were treated as cross-origin.
