### Minor Changes

- Introduce experimental support for passkeys in Expo (iOS, Android, and Web). ([#4352](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4352)) by [@AlexNti](https://github.com/AlexNti)

  To use passkeys in Expo projects, pass the `__experimental_passkeys` object, which can be imported from `@clerk/clerk-expo/passkeys`, to the `ClerkProvider` component:

  ```tsx
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
  import { passkeys } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/passkeys';

  <ClerkProvider __experimental_passkeys={passkeys}>{/* Your app here */}</ClerkProvider>;
  ```

  The API for using passkeys in Expo projects is the same as the one used in web apps:

  ```tsx
  // passkey creation
  const { user } = useUser();

  const handleCreatePasskey = async () => {
    if (!user) return;
    try {
      return await user.createPasskey();
    } catch (e: any) {
      // handle error
    }
  };

  // passkey authentication
  const { signIn, setActive } = useSignIn();

  const handlePasskeySignIn = async () => {
    try {
      const signInResponse = await signIn.authenticateWithPasskey();
      await setActive({ session: signInResponse.createdSessionId });
    } catch (err: any) {
      //handle error
    }
  };
  ```

  - @clerk/types@4.13.1

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `nonce` to clerk-js' script loading options. Also adds a `nonce` prop to `ClerkProvider`. This can be used to thread a nonce value through to the clerk-js script load to support apps using a `strict-dynamic` content security policy. For next.js applications, the nonce will be automatically pulled from the CSP header and threaded through without needing any props so long as the provider is server-rendered.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Support reading / writing / removing suffixed/un-suffixed cookies from `@clerk/clerk-js` and `@clerk/backend`. by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

  The `__session`, `__clerk_db_jwt` and `__client_uat` cookies will now include a suffix derived from the instance's publishakeKey. The cookie name suffixes are used to prevent cookie collisions, effectively enabling support for multiple Clerk applications running on the same domain.

### Patch Changes

  - @clerk/types@4.6.0

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a custom logger to allow logging a message or warning to the console once per session, in order to avoid consecutive identical logs due to component rerenders. ([#3383](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3383)) by [@desiprisg](https://github.com/desiprisg)

- With the next major release, NextJS@15 will depend on `react` and `react-dom` v19, which is still in beta. We are updating our peer dependencies accordingly in order to accept `react` and `react-dom` @ `19.0.0-beta` ([#3428](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3428)) by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Unpin the version of swr and allow any minor or patch version. ([#3399](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3399)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Re-organize cookie codebase into a central place, fix TokenUpdate event to be triggered on sign-out and drop duplicate event on refreshing token. ([#3362](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3362)) by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Introduce new `client_mismatch` verification status for email link sign-in and sign-up. This error (and its message) will be shown if a verification link was opened in another device/browser from which the user initiated the sign-in/sign-up attempt. This functionality needs to be enabled in the Clerk dashboard. ([#3367](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3367)) by [@mzhong9723](https://github.com/mzhong9723)

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- The following are all internal changes and not relevant to any end-user: ([#3341](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3341)) by [@LauraBeatris](https://github.com/LauraBeatris)

  Add telemetry events for `useSignIn`, `useSignUp`, `useOrganizations` and `useOrganizationList`

- The following are all internal changes and not relevant to any end-user: ([#3329](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3329)) by [@LauraBeatris](https://github.com/LauraBeatris)

  Create type interface for `TelemetryCollector` on `@clerk/types`. This allows to assign `telemetry` on the main Clerk SDK object, while inheriting from the actual `TelemetryCollector` implementation.

- Fix detection of legacy publishable keys when determining the default Clerk API URL. Previously, legacy keys would be treated as local. ([#3333](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3333)) by [@BRKalow](https://github.com/BRKalow)

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Internal change to add client-side caching to Clerk's telemetry. This prevents event flooding in frequently executed code paths, such as for React hooks or components. Gracefully falls back to the old behavior if e.g. `localStorage` is not available. As such, no public API changes and user changes are required. ([#3287](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3287)) by [@LauraBeatris](https://github.com/LauraBeatris)

- The following are all internal changes and not relevant to any end-user: ([#3279](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3279)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  - Rename the existing `eventComponentMounted` function inside `/telemetry` to `eventPrebuiltComponentMounted`. This better reflects that its `props` argument will be filtered for a relevant list for Clerk's prebuilt/all-in-one components.
  - Reuse the now freed up `eventComponentMounted` name to create a new helper function that accepts a flat object for its `props` but doesn't filter any. This is useful for components that are not prebuilt.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- The package was reworked to allow for better isomorphic use cases and ESM support, resulting in some breaking changes. It now allows for [subpath exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) and restricts some imports to specific subpaths. ([#1898](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1898)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  Instead of importing from the root `@clerk/shared` import you can now use subpaths for most things:

  ```diff
  - import { deprecated, OrganizationProvider } from "@clerk/shared"
  + import { deprecated } from "@clerk/shared/deprecated"
  + import { OrganizationProvider } from "@clerk/shared/react"
  ```

  By using subpaths you can tell bundlers to only bundle specific parts, potentially helping with tree-shaking. It also mitigates issues where e.g. modules only relevant for React where picked up in Node.js-only environments.

  If you're not using `@clerk/shared` directly (only by proxy through e.g. `@clerk/clerk-react`) you don't need to do anything. If you are relying on `@clerk/shared`, please read through the breaking changes below and change your code accordingly. You can rely on your IDE to give you hints on which exports are available at `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/shared/<name>` subpaths.

  **Breaking Changes**

  - `@clerk/shared` was and still is a dual CJS/ESM package. The ESM files provided by `@clerk/shared` now use `.mjs` file extensions and also define them in their import paths, following the ESM spec. Your bundler should handle this for you.
  - Some imports where moved from the root `@clerk/shared` import to isolated subpaths.

    - Helper utils for cookies and globs:

      ```diff
      - import { createCookieHandler, globs } from "@clerk/shared"
      + import { createCookieHandler } from "@clerk/shared/cookie"
      + import { globs } from "@clerk/shared/globs"
      ```

    - Everything related to React. Below is a small example and the full list of exports:

      ```diff
      - import { useSafeLayoutEffect, ClerkInstanceContext } from "@clerk/shared"
      + import { useSafeLayoutEffect, ClerkInstanceContext } from "@clerk/shared/react"
      ```

      Full list of exports moved to `@clerk/shared/react`:

      ```ts
      export {
        ClerkInstanceContext,
        ClientContext,
        OrganizationContext,
        OrganizationProvider,
        SessionContext,
        UserContext,
        assertContextExists,
        createContextAndHook,
        useClerkInstanceContext,
        useClientContext,
        useOrganization,
        useOrganizationContext,
        useOrganizationList,
        useOrganizations,
        useSafeLayoutEffect,
        useSessionContext,
        useUserContext,
      };
      ```

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- ESM/CJS support for `@clerk/clerk-react` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  Changes that should affect users and OS contributors:

  - Better source map support for `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared`. This affects anyone developing in our monorepo or anyone using a debugger with Clerk installed in their app.
  - Easier node_modules debugging as `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/nextjs` are no longer getting bundled as a single-file package. This also improves error logging in nextjs a lot, as nextjs usually logs the line that threw the error - a minified, single-file package, usually consists of a very long single-line module, so logging error in NextJS wasn't ideal.
  - Headless clerk-js bundle size reduced by ~10kb, normal clerk-ks by ~6kb
  - A new `clerkJSVersion` prop has been added on ClerkProvider allowing to fetch a specific clerk-js version.
