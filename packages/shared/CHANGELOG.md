# Change Log

## 2.0.0-alpha-v5.0

### Major Changes

- Internal update default apiUrl domain from clerk.dev to clerk.com ([#1878](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1878)) by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

- Dropping support for Node 14 and 16 as they both reached EOL status. The minimal Node.js version required by Clerk is `18.18.0` now. ([#1864](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1864)) by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

### Minor Changes

- Expose `revalidate` and `setData` for paginated lists of data in organization hooks. ([#1745](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1745)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  `const {userMemberships:{revalidate, setData}} = useOrganizationList({userMemberships:true})`

- Introduce isomorphic `isomorphicBtoa` helper in `@clerk/shared`. ([#1864](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1864)) by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

### Patch Changes

- Rename the @staging tag to @canary. Drop support for @next tag. ([#2015](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2015)) by [@anagstef](https://github.com/anagstef)

- Remove `"sideEffects": "false"` since the package has side-effects ([#1974](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1974)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

- Introduce `isTruthy` helper to better cast environment variables to a boolean. Previously only the string `"true"` was checked, now `true`, `"true"`, `"1"`, and `1` will work. ([#2002](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2002)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

- Improve the default value for `CLERK_API_URL` by utilizing the publishable key to differentiate between local, staging and prod environments. ([#1955](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1955)) by [@desiprisg](https://github.com/desiprisg)

- Add clerkTraceId to ClerkBackendApiResponse and ClerkAPIResponseError to allow for better tracing and debugging API error responses. ([#1986](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1986)) by [@Nikpolik](https://github.com/Nikpolik)

  Uses `clerk_trace_id` when available in a response and defaults to [`cf-ray` identifier](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/cloudflare-ray-id/) if missing.

- Improve compatibility with Expo ([#1958](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1958)) by [@clerk-cookie](https://github.com/clerk-cookie)

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- The package was reworked to allow for better isomorphic use cases and ESM support, resulting in some breaking changes. It now allows for [subpath exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) and restricts some imports to specific subpaths. ([#1898](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1898)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  Instead of importing from the root `@clerk/shared` import you can now use subpaths for most things:

  ```diff
  - import { deprecated, OrganizationProvider } from "@clerk/shared"
  + import { deprecated } from "@clerk/shared/deprecated"
  + import { OrganizationProvider } from "@clerk/shared/react"
  ```

  By using subpaths you can tell bundlers to only bundle specific parts, potentially helping with tree-shaking. It also mitigates issues where e.g. modules only relevant for React where picked up in Node.js-only environments.

  If you're not using `@clerk/shared` directly (only by proxy through e.g. `@clerk/clerk-react`) you don't need to do anything. If you are relying on `@clerk/shared`, please read through the breaking changes below and change your code accordingly. You can rely on your IDE to give you hints on which exports are available at `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/shared/<name>` subpaths.

  **Breaking Changes**

  - `@clerk/shared` was and still is a dual CJS/ESM package. The ESM files provided by `@clerk/shared` now use `.mjs` file extensions and also define them in their import paths, following the ESM spec. Your bundler should handle this for you.
  - Some imports where moved from the root `@clerk/shared` import to isolated subpaths.

    - Helper utils for cookies and globs:

      ```diff
      - import { createCookieHandler, globs } from "@clerk/shared"
      + import { createCookieHandler } from "@clerk/shared/cookie"
      + import { globs } from "@clerk/shared/globs"
      ```

    - Everything related to React. Below is a small example and the full list of exports:

      ```diff
      - import { useSafeLayoutEffect, ClerkInstanceContext } from "@clerk/shared"
      + import { useSafeLayoutEffect, ClerkInstanceContext } from "@clerk/shared/react"
      ```

      Full list of exports moved to `@clerk/shared/react`:

      ```ts
      export {
        ClerkInstanceContext,
        ClientContext,
        OrganizationContext,
        OrganizationProvider,
        SessionContext,
        UserContext,
        assertContextExists,
        createContextAndHook,
        useClerkInstanceContext,
        useClientContext,
        useOrganization,
        useOrganizationContext,
        useOrganizationList,
        useOrganizations,
        useSafeLayoutEffect,
        useSessionContext,
        useUserContext,
      };
      ```

  If you run into an issues that might be a bug, please [open a bug report](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=needs-triage&projects=&template=BUG_REPORT.yml) with a minimal reproduction.

### Patch Changes

Restore the original PR and add additional `use client` directives to ensure it works correctly. by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

## 0.24.2

### Patch Changes

- Introduce ClerkRuntimeError class for localizing error messages in ClerkJS components ([#1813](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1813)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

- Pins the internal dependency versions. This ensures that users installing our main framework SDKs will get consistent versions across all @clerk/ packages. ([#1798](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1798)) by [@BRKalow](https://github.com/BRKalow)

## 0.24.1

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- ESM/CJS support for `@clerk/clerk-react` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  Changes that should affect users and OS contributors:

  - Better source map support for `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared`. This affects anyone developing in our monorepo or anyone using a debugger with Clerk installed in their app.
  - Easier node_modules debugging as `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/nextjs` are no longer getting bundled as a single-file package. This also improves error logging in nextjs a lot, as nextjs usually logs the line that threw the error - a minified, single-file package, usually consists of a very long single-line module, so logging error in NextJS wasn't ideal.
  - Headless clerk-js bundle size reduced by ~10kb, normal clerk-ks by ~6kb
  - A new `clerkJSVersion` prop has been added on ClerkProvider allowing to fetch a specific clerk-js version.
