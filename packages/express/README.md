## Getting Started

[Clerk](https://clerk.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_express) is the easiest way to add authentication and user management to your Express application. Add sign up, sign in, and profile management to your application in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=18.17.0` or later
- An existing Clerk application. [Create your account for free](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_express).
- An existing Express application (follow their [Getting started](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) guide)

### Installation

```sh
npm install @clerk/express
```

## Usage

Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and inside the **API Keys** section copy the publishable key and secret key.

Paste your keys into an `.env` file:

```sh
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_*******
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_******
```

Ensure that the environment variables are loaded, for example by using `dotenv` at the top of your Express application:

```js
import 'dotenv/config';

// Rest of application
```

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Express application. It is required to be set in the middleware chain before using other Clerk utilities, such as `requireAuth` and `getAuth()`.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express';

const app = express();

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware());

// Pass a function that will run as middleware
app.use(clerkMiddleware(handler));

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options));

// Pass both
app.use(clerkMiddleware(handler, options));
```

### `requireAuth`

`requireAuth` is a middleware function that you can use to protect routes in your Express.js application. This function checks if the user is authenticated, and returns a 401 status code if they are not.

`clerkMiddleware()` is required to be set in the middleware chain before this util is used.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const port = 3000;

// Apply centralized middleware
app.use(clerkMiddleware());

// Define a protected route
app.get('/protected', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route');
});

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### `getAuth()`

The `getAuth()` helper retrieves authentication state from the request object. See the [Next.js reference documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) for more information on how to use it.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth } from '@clerk/express';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Apply centralized middleware
app.use(clerkMiddleware());

// Protect a route based on authorization status
hasPermission = (request, response, next) => {
  const auth = getAuth(request);

  // Handle if the user is not authorized
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:testpermission' })) {
    response.status(403).send('Forbidden');
    return;
  }

  return next();
};

app.get('/path', requireAuth, hasPermission, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth));

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### `clerkClient`

[Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) exposes Clerk's Backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. For example, if you wanted to get a list of all users in your application, instead of creating a fetch to Clerk's `https://api.clerk.com/v1/users` endpoint, you can use the `users.getUserList()` method provided by the JavaScript Backend SDK.

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/backend/overview#usage) for more information.

```js
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/express';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const users = await clerkClient.users.getUserList();

app.get('/users', requireAuth, (req, res) => res.json(users));

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
