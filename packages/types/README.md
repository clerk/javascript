## Overview

This package provides the TypeScript type declarations for Clerk libraries.

## Getting Started

It is worth noting that Clerk packages automatically include their type declarations when installed so adding this package manually is not typically necessary.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @clerk/types
```

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

To build types in watch mode, run the following:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Example implementation:

```ts
import type { OAuthStrategy } from '@clerk/types';

export type OAuthProps = {
  oAuthOptions: OAuthStrategy[];
  error?: string;
  setError?: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string | undefined>>;
};
```
