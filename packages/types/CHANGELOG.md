  - `experimental_verifySession` for creating a new SessionVerification record and initiating a new flow.
  - `experimental_verifySessionPrepareFirstFactor` for preparing a supported first factor like `phone_code`
  - `experimental_verifySessionAttemptFirstFactor` for attempting a supported first factor like `password`
  - `experimental_verifySessionPrepareSecondFactor` for preparing a supported second factor like `phone_code`

- In certain situations the Frontend API response contains [`supported_first_factors`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/Sign-Ins#operation/createSignIn!c=200&path=response/supported_first_factors&t=response) with a `null` value while the current code always assumed to receive an array. `SignInResource['supportedFirstFactors']` has been updated to account for that and any code accessing this value has been made more resilient against `null` values. ([#3938](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3938)) by [@dstaley](https://github.com/dstaley)

## 4.13.0

  Example:

  ```typescript
      import { createClerkClient }  from '@clerk/backend';

      const clerkClient = createClerkClient({...});
      // Update user with createOrganizationsLimit equals 10
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser('user_...', { createOrganizationsLimit: 10 })

      // Remove createOrganizationsLimit
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser('user_...', { createOrganizationsLimit: 0 })
  ```

## 4.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Introducing a development mode warning when in development mode in order to mitigate going to production with development keys. ([#3870](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3870)) by [@octoper](https://github.com/octoper)

  In case need to deactivate this UI change temporarily to simulate how components will look in production, you can do so by adding the `unsafe_disableDevelopmentModeWarnings` layout appearance prop to `<ClerkProvider>`

  Example:

  ```tsx
  <ClerkProvider
    appearance={{
      layout: {
        unsafe_disableDevelopmentModeWarnings: true,
      },
    }}
  />
  ```

## 4.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Introduce support for custom menu items in `<UserButton/>`. ([#3784](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3784)) by [@nikospapcom](https://github.com/nikospapcom)

  - Use `<UserButton.MenuItems>` as a child component to wrap custom menu items.
  - Use `<UserButton.Link/>` for creating external or internal links.
  - Use `<UserButton.Action/>` for opening a specific custom page of "UserProfile" or to trigger your own custom logic via `onClick`.
  - If needed, reorder existing items like `manageAccount` and `signOut`

  New usage example:

  ```jsx
  <UserButton>
    <UserButton.MenuItems>
      <UserButton.Link label="Terms" labelIcon={<Icon />} href="/terms" />
      <UserButton.Action label="Help" labelIcon={<Icon />} open="help" /> //
      Navigate to `/help` page when UserProfile opens as a modal. (Requires a
      custom page to have been set in `/help`)
      <UserButton.Action label="manageAccount" labelIcon={<Icon />} />
      <UserButton.Action
        label="Chat Modal"
        labelIcon={<Icon />}
        onClick={() => setModal(true)}
      />

  Developers can now configure these directly in `ClerkProvider` and have them work properly without in UserButton, UserProfile and in impersonation mode.

## 4.6.1

### Minor Changes

- Add support for GoogleOneTap. New APIs listed: ([#3392](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3392)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  ### React component

  - `<GoogleOneTap/>`

  Customize the UX of the prompt

  ```tsx
  <GoogleOneTap
    cancelOnTapOutside={false}
    itpSupport={false}
    fedCmSupport={false}
  />
  ```

  ### Use the component from with Vanilla JS

  - `Clerk.openGoogleOneTap(props: GoogleOneTapProps)`
  - `Clerk.closeGoogleOneTap()`

  ### Low level APIs for custom flows

  - `await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({ token: 'xxxx'})`
  - `await Clerk.handleGoogleOneTapCallback()`

  We recommend using this two methods together in order and let Clerk to perform the correct redirections.

  ```tsx
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    callback: async (response) => {
      const signInOrUp = await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({
        token: response.credential,
      });
      await Clerk.handleGoogleOneTapCallback(signInOrUp, {
        signInForceRedirectUrl: window.location.href,
      });
    },
  });
  ```

  In case you want to handle the redirection and session management yourself you can do so like this

  ```tsx
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    callback: async (response) => {
      const signInOrUp = await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({
        token: response.credential,
      });
      if (signInOrUp.status === "complete") {
        await Clerk.setActive({
          session: signInOrUp.createdSessionId,
        });
      }
    },
  });
  ```

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Replace mount with open for GoogleOneTap. New api is `__experimental_openGoogleOneTap`. ([#3379](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3379)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

## 4.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a descriptor for Invitation previews in <OrganizationSwitcher/> ([#3376](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3376)) by [@EmmanouelaPothitou](https://github.com/EmmanouelaPothitou)

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Updates related to experimental Google One Tap support ([#3250](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3250)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  - By default we are returning back to the location where the flow started.
    To accomplish that internally we will use the redirect_url query parameter to build the url.

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap />
  ```

  - In the above example if there is a SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL or SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL set then the developer would need to pass new values as props like this

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap
    signInForceRedirectUrl=""
    signUpForceRedirectUrl=""
  />
  ```

  - Let the developer configure the experience they want to offer. (All these values are true by default)

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap
    cancelOnTapOutside={false}
    itpSupport={false}
    fedCmSupport={false}
  />
  ```

  - Moved authenticateWithGoogleOneTap to Clerk singleton

  ```ts
  Clerk.__experimental_authenticateWithGoogleOneTap;
  ```

  - Created the handleGoogleOneTapCallback in Clerk singleton

  ```ts
  Clerk.__experimental_handleGoogleOneTapCallback;
  ```

- Introduce new `client_mismatch` verification status for email link sign-in and sign-up. This error (and its message) will be shown if a verification link was opened in another device/browser from which the user initiated the sign-in/sign-up attempt. This functionality needs to be enabled in the Clerk dashboard. ([#3367](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3367)) by [@mzhong9723](https://github.com/mzhong9723)

## 4.2.1

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Allow localization of text in social buttons when many are listed. ([#3282](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3282)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Remove experimental Passkeys APIs. This includes any API that is marked as experimental or has the `__experimental_` prefix. ([#3233](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3233)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  This prepares the Passkeys release to move further along towards a beta release and eventual stable release.

  - Protect can now be used without required props. In this case behaves as `<SignedIn>`, if no authorization props are passed.
  - `has` will throw an error if neither `permission` or `role` is passed.
  - `auth().protect()` for Nextjs App Router. Allow per page protection in app router. This utility will automatically throw a 404 error if user is not authorized or authenticated.
