## 4.97.0

### Minor Changes

- Deprecate `@clerk/types` in favor of `@clerk/shared/types` ([#7022](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/7022)) by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  The `@clerk/types` package is now deprecated. All type definitions have been consolidated and moved to `@clerk/shared/types` to improve consistency across the Clerk ecosystem.

  **Backward Compatibility:**

  The `@clerk/types` package will remain available and will continue to re-export all types from `@clerk/shared/types` to ensure backward compatibility. Existing applications will continue to work without any immediate breaking changes. However, we strongly recommend migrating to `@clerk/shared/types` as new type definitions and updates will only be added to `@clerk/shared/types` starting with the next major release.

  **Migration Steps:**

  Please update your imports from `@clerk/types` to `@clerk/shared/types`:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import type { ClerkResource, UserResource } from '@clerk/types';

  // After
  import type { ClerkResource, UserResource } from '@clerk/shared/types';
  ```

  **What Changed:**

  All type definitions including:
  - Resource types (User, Organization, Session, etc.)
  - API response types
  - Configuration types
  - Authentication types
  - Error types
  - And all other shared types

  Have been moved from `packages/types/src` to `packages/shared/src/types` and are now exported via `@clerk/shared/types`.

  With the new `oauthFlow` prop, developers can opt-in to using a popup window instead of redirects for their OAuth flows by setting `oauthFlow` to `"popup"`. While we still recommend the default `"redirect"` for most scenarios, the `"popup"` option is useful in environments where the redirect flow does not currently work, such as when your application is embedded into an `iframe`. We also opt applications into the `"popup"` flow when we detect that your application is running on a domain that's typically embedded into an `iframe`, such as `loveable.app`.

### Minor Changes

- Introduce experimental support for passkeys in Expo (iOS, Android, and Web). ([#4352](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4352)) by [@AlexNti](https://github.com/AlexNti)

  To use passkeys in Expo projects, pass the `__experimental_passkeys` object, which can be imported from `@clerk/clerk-expo/passkeys`, to the `ClerkProvider` component:

  ```tsx
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
  import { passkeys } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/passkeys';

  <ClerkProvider __experimental_passkeys={passkeys}>{/* Your app here */}</ClerkProvider>;
  ```

  The API for using passkeys in Expo projects is the same as the one used in web apps:

  ```tsx
  // passkey creation
  const { user } = useUser();

  const handleCreatePasskey = async () => {
    if (!user) return;
    try {
      return await user.createPasskey();
    } catch (e: any) {
      // handle error
    }
  };

  // passkey authentication
  const { signIn, setActive } = useSignIn();

  const handlePasskeySignIn = async () => {
    try {
      const signInResponse = await signIn.authenticateWithPasskey();
      await setActive({ session: signInResponse.createdSessionId });
    } catch (err: any) {
      //handle error
    }
  };
  ```

  - Allow users to request access with an email address via the new `<Waitlist />` component.
  - Show `Join waitlist` prompt from `<SignIn />` component when mode is `waitlist`.
  - Appropriate the text in the Sign Up component when mode is `waitlist`.
  - Added `joinWaitlist()` method in `Clerk` singleton.

## 4.26.0

### Minor Changes

  Drop types `__experimental_SessionVerificationConfig` and `__experimental_SessionVerificationMaxAgeMinutes`.

- The "Restricted access" screen has been improved for visual consistency and the ability to contact support. The displayed texts have been made more clear and the sign-in button has been moved to the bottom. ([#4335](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4335)) by [@nikospapcom](https://github.com/nikospapcom)

- Add experimental standalone mode for `<UserButton />` and `<OrganizationSwitcher />`. ([#4042](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4042)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  When `__experimental_asStandalone: true` the component will not render its trigger, and instead it will render only the contents of the popover in place.

  APIs that changed:
  - (For internal usage) Added `__experimental_prefetchOrganizationSwitcher` as a way to mount an internal component that will render the `useOrganizationList()` hook and prefetch the necessary data for the popover of `<OrganizationSwitcher />`. This enhances the UX since no loading state will be visible and keeps CLS to the minimum.
  - New property for `mountOrganizationSwitcher(node, { __experimental_asStandalone: true })`
  - New property for `mountUserButton(node, { __experimental_asStandalone: true })`

- Use EIP-4361 message spec for Web3 wallets sign in signature requests ([#4334](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4334)) by [@chanioxaris](https://github.com/chanioxaris)

    - Allowed values 'veryStrict' | 'strict' | 'moderate' | 'lax'

## 4.24.0

### Minor Changes

- Drop the experimental mounted variant of `UserVerification`. ([#4266](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4266)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  Removes:
  - `<__experimental_UserVerification/>`
  - `__experimental_mountUserVerification()`
  - `__experimental_unmountUserVerification()`

- _Experimental Feature_: `<UserProfile/>` allows users to update their information. Mostly of this information is considered sensitive data. ([#4127](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4127)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  We want to ensure that only the users themselves can alter any sensitive data.

  To increase security we are now, require users to re-verify their credentials when they are about to perform these actions:

  | Operation                        | Reverification | Strategy            | Timeframe |

([#3938](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3938)) by [@dstaley](https://github.com/dstaley)

## 4.13.0

  Example:

  ```typescript
      import { createClerkClient }  from '@clerk/backend';

      const clerkClient = createClerkClient({...});
      // Update user with createOrganizationsLimit equals 10
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser('user_...', { createOrganizationsLimit: 10 })

      // Remove createOrganizationsLimit
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser('user_...', { createOrganizationsLimit: 0 })
  ```

## 4.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Introducing a development mode warning when in development mode in order to mitigate going to production with development keys. ([#3870](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3870)) by [@octoper](https://github.com/octoper)

  In case need to deactivate this UI change temporarily to simulate how components will look in production, you can do so by adding the `unsafe_disableDevelopmentModeWarnings` layout appearance prop to `<ClerkProvider>`

  Example:

  ```tsx
  <ClerkProvider
    appearance={{
      layout: {
        unsafe_disableDevelopmentModeWarnings: true,
      },
    }}
  />
  ```

  - Use `<UserButton.Link/>` for creating external or internal links.
  - Use `<UserButton.Action/>` for opening a specific custom page of "UserProfile" or to trigger your own custom logic via `onClick`.
  - If needed, reorder existing items like `manageAccount` and `signOut`

  New usage example:

  ```jsx
  <UserButton>
    <UserButton.MenuItems>
      <UserButton.Link
        label='Terms'
        labelIcon={<Icon />}
        href='/terms'
      />
      <UserButton.Action
        label='Help'

      />{' '}
      // Navigate to `/help` page when UserProfile opens as a modal. (Requires a custom page to have been set in
      `/help`)
      <UserButton.Action
        label='manageAccount'
        labelIcon={<Icon />}
      />

  Developers can now configure these directly in `ClerkProvider` and have them work properly without in UserButton, UserProfile and in impersonation mode.

## 4.6.1

### Minor Changes

- Add support for GoogleOneTap. New APIs listed: ([#3392](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3392)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  ### React component
  - `<GoogleOneTap/>`

  Customize the UX of the prompt

  ```tsx
  <GoogleOneTap
    cancelOnTapOutside={false}
    itpSupport={false}
    fedCmSupport={false}
  />
  ```

  ### Use the component from with Vanilla JS
  - `Clerk.openGoogleOneTap(props: GoogleOneTapProps)`
  - `Clerk.closeGoogleOneTap()`

  ### Low level APIs for custom flows
  - `await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({ token: 'xxxx'})`
  - `await Clerk.handleGoogleOneTapCallback()`

  We recommend using this two methods together in order and let Clerk to perform the correct redirections.

  ```tsx
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    callback: async response => {
      const signInOrUp = await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({
        token: response.credential,
      });
      await Clerk.handleGoogleOneTapCallback(signInOrUp, {
        signInForceRedirectUrl: window.location.href,
      });
    },
  });
  ```

  In case you want to handle the redirection and session management yourself you can do so like this

  ```tsx
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    callback: async response => {
      const signInOrUp = await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({
        token: response.credential,
      });
      if (signInOrUp.status === 'complete') {
        await Clerk.setActive({
          session: signInOrUp.createdSessionId,
        });
      }
    },
  });
  ```

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Replace mount with open for GoogleOneTap. New api is `__experimental_openGoogleOneTap`. ([#3379](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3379)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

## 4.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a descriptor for Invitation previews in <OrganizationSwitcher/> ([#3376](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3376)) by [@EmmanouelaPothitou](https://github.com/EmmanouelaPothitou)

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Updates related to experimental Google One Tap support ([#3250](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3250)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)
  - By default we are returning back to the location where the flow started.
    To accomplish that internally we will use the redirect_url query parameter to build the url.

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap />
  ```

  - In the above example if there is a SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL or SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL set then the developer would need to pass new values as props like this

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap
    signInForceRedirectUrl=''
    signUpForceRedirectUrl=''
  />
  ```

  - Let the developer configure the experience they want to offer. (All these values are true by default)

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap
    cancelOnTapOutside={false}
    itpSupport={false}
    fedCmSupport={false}
  />
  ```

  - Moved authenticateWithGoogleOneTap to Clerk singleton

  ```ts
  Clerk.__experimental_authenticateWithGoogleOneTap;
  ```

  - Created the handleGoogleOneTapCallback in Clerk singleton

  ```ts
  Clerk.__experimental_handleGoogleOneTapCallback;
  ```

- Introduce new `client_mismatch` verification status for email link sign-in and sign-up. This error (and its message) will be shown if a verification link was opened in another device/browser from which the user initiated the sign-in/sign-up attempt. This functionality needs to be enabled in the Clerk dashboard. ([#3367](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3367)) by [@mzhong9723](https://github.com/mzhong9723)
