  You're calling 'getAuth()' from a server function, without providing the request object.
  Example:

  export const someServerFunction = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
    const request = getWebRequest()
    const auth = getAuth(request);
    ...
  });

It looks like you're trying to use Clerk without configuring the Clerk handler.

To fix this, make sure you have the \`createClerkHandler()\` configured in you custom server handler file (example: src/server.ts).
