## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Initial beta release of `@clerk/react-router`. ([#4621](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/4621)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  [React Router v7](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7) was released and Clerk's existing `@clerk/remix` SDK isn't compatible anymore. Thus the need for a brand new SDK came up. `@clerk/react-router` allows you to use React Router v7 + Clerk both in framework/library mode.

  Read the [React Router quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/react-router) and [reference documenation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react-router/overview) to learn more.
