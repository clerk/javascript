# @clerk/agent-toolkit

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Introduce `@clerk/agent-toolkit` package. The Clerk Agent Toolkit enables popular agent frameworks, including Vercel's AI SDK and LangChain, to integrate with Clerk using tools (also known as function calling). ([#5130](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/5130)) by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  This package exposes a subset of Clerk's functionality to agent frameworks, allowing you to build powerful agentic systems capable of managing users, user data, organizations, and more.

  **Please note:** All relevant information and instructions on how to set it up can be found in the package's README. It's an early developer preview and can't be considered stable yet.
