[Clerk](https://clerk.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_nuxt) is the easiest way to add authentication and user management to your Vue application. Add sign up, sign in, and profile management to your application in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Nuxt 3 or later
- Node.js `>=18.17.0` or later
- An existing Clerk application. [Create your account for free](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_nuxt).

### Installation

Add `@clerk/nuxt` as a dependency

```bash
npm install @clerk/nuxt
```

### Build

To build the package locally with the TypeScript compiler, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

Make sure the following environment variables are set in a `.env` file in your Nuxt project:

```
NUXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[publishable-key]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[secret-key]
```

Then, add `@clerk/nuxt` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.ts`:

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
});
```

You can now start using Clerk's components. Here's a basic example showing a header component:

```vue
<template>
  <header>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <SignedIn>
      <UserButton />
    </SignedIn>
    <SignedOut>
      <SignInButton mode="modal" />
    </SignedOut>
  </header>
</template>
```

To protect an API route, you can access the `event.context.auth` object and check the value of `userId` to determine if the user is authenticated:

```ts
export default eventHandler(event => {
  const { userId } = event.context.auth;

  if (!userId) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      message: 'Unauthorized',
    });
  }

  return { userId };
});
```
