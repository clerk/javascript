# Clerk Backend Core SDK

_Clerk Backend API core resources and authentication utilities for JavaScript environments._

```diff
! This package provides low-level utilities and is mostly used as the base for other Clerk SDKs.
```

## Usage

```sh
npm install @clerk/backend-core
# or
yarn add @clerk/backend-core
```

## Architecture

`@clerk/backend-core` contains all the logic for basic Clerk functionalities such as:

- Determining the authentication state of a session.
- Validating a Clerk token state.
- Clerk API resource management.

without being platform/environment specific.

### How it works

This package is used as the base building block for Clerk JavaScript SDKs and environments. This is achieved by providing all the required business logic if only a few environment-specific utilities are implemented by the client.

</p>

In essence, the client should supply these key functions in the Clerk [Base](./src/Base.ts#47) and [ClerkBackendAPI](./src/api/ClerkBackendAPI.ts) classes:

1. Public key import `importKeyFunction`.
2. JWT signature verification `verifySignatureFunction`.
3. Base64 decoding `decodeBase64Function`.
4. HTTP fetching utility for the API resource management `ClerkFetcher`.

After supplying those in the `Base` and `ClerkBackendAPI` classes, you can use all the Clerk utilities required for the SDK business logic.

### Creating a Base for a new SDK

```ts
const importKey = async (jwk: JsonWebKey, algorithm: Algorithm) => {
  //  ...
};

const verifySignature = async (algorithm: Algorithm, key: CryptoKey, signature: Uint8Array, data: Uint8Array) => {
  // ...
};

const decodeBase64 = (base64: string) => {
  // ...
};

/** Base initialization */

const examplePlatformBase = new Base(importKey, verifySignature, decodeBase64);
```

After creating the `Base` instance you can use core functions such as:

```ts
examplePlatformBase.verifySessionToken(...);

examplePlatformBase.getAuthState(...);
```

The `Base` utilities include the building blocks for developing any extra logic and middleware required for the target platform.

### Validate the Authorized Party of a session token

Clerk's JWT session token, contains the azp claim, which equals the Origin of the request during token generation. You can provide a list of whitelisted origins to verify against, during every token verification, to protect your application of the subdomain cookie leaking attack. You can find an example below:

```ts
const authorizedParties = ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com'];

examplePlatformBase.verifySessionToken(token > { authorizedParties });
```

### Clerk API Resources

API resource management is also provided by this package through the [ClerkBackendAPI](./src/api/ClerkBackendAPI.ts) class. For more information on the API resources you can checkout the [resource documentation page](https://docs.clerk.dev/reference/backend-api-reference).

To use the Clerk Backend API wrapper in any JavaScript platform, you would need to provide some specific SDK information and an HTTP fetching utility. See more at the [ClerkBackendAPIProps](./src/api/ClerkBackendAPI.ts#17) implementation.
