/**
 * The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).
 *
 * @example
 * ### Check the current state of a sign-in
 *
 * The following example uses the `useSignIn()` hook to access the [`SignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.
 *
 * ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/SignInPage.tsx' }}
 * import { useSignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react'
 *
 * export default function SignInPage() {
 *   const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn()
 *
 *   if (!isLoaded) {
 *     // Handle loading state
 *     return null
 *   }
 *
 *   return <div>The current sign-in attempt status is {signIn?.status}.</div>
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ### Create a custom sign-in flow with `useSignIn()`
 *
 * The `useSignIn()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignIn()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview).
