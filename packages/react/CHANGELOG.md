## 4.27.0

### Minor Changes

- Introduce customization in `UserProfile` and `OrganizationProfile` ([#1822](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/1822)) by [@anagstef](https://github.com/anagstef)

  The `<UserProfile />` component now allows the addition of custom pages and external links to the navigation sidebar. Custom pages can be created using the `<UserProfile.Page>` component, and external links can be added using the `<UserProfile.Link>` component. The default routes, such as `Account` and `Security`, can be reordered.

  Example React API usage:

  ```tsx
  <UserProfile>
    <UserProfile.Page
      label='Custom Page'
      url='custom'
      labelIcon={<CustomIcon />}
    >
      <MyCustomPageContent />
    </UserProfile.Page>
    <UserProfile.Link
      label='External'
      url='/home'
      labelIcon={<Icon />}
    />
    <UserProfile.Page label='account' />
    <UserProfile.Page label='security' />
  </UserProfile>
  ```

  Custom pages and links should be provided as children using the `<UserButton.UserProfilePage>` and `<UserButton.UserProfileLink>` components when using the `UserButton` component.

  The `<OrganizationProfile />` component now supports the addition of custom pages and external links to the navigation sidebar. Custom pages can be created using the `<OrganizationProfile.Page>` component, and external links can be added using the `<OrganizationProfile.Link>` component. The default routes, such as `Members` and `Settings`, can be reordered.

  Example React API usage:

  ```tsx
  <OrganizationProfile>
    <OrganizationProfile.Page
      label='Custom Page'
      url='custom'
      labelIcon={<CustomIcon />}
    >
      <MyCustomPageContent />
    </OrganizationProfile.Page>
    <OrganizationProfile.Link
      label='External'
      url='/home'
      labelIcon={<Icon />}
    />
    <OrganizationProfile.Page label='members' />
    <OrganizationProfile.Page label='settings' />
  </OrganizationProfile>
  ```

  Custom pages and links should be provided as children using the `<OrganizationSwitcher.OrganizationProfilePage>` and `<OrganizationSwitcher.OrganizationProfileLink>` components when using the `OrganizationSwitcher` component.

## 4.19.0

### Minor Changes

- ESM/CJS support for `@clerk/clerk-react` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  Changes that should affect users and OS contributors:

  - Better source map support for `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared`. This affects anyone developing in our monorepo or anyone using a debugger with Clerk installed in their app.
  - Easier node_modules debugging as `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/nextjs` are no longer getting bundled as a single-file package. This also improves error logging in nextjs a lot, as nextjs usually logs the line that threw the error - a minified, single-file package, usually consists of a very long single-line module, so logging error in NextJS wasn't ideal.
  - Headless clerk-js bundle size reduced by ~10kb, normal clerk-ks by ~6kb
  - A new `clerkJSVersion` prop has been added on ClerkProvider allowing to fetch a specific clerk-js version.
