## Overview

Clerk is the easiest way to add authentication and user management to your React application. Add sign up, sign in, and profile management to your application in minutes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- React v16+
- Node.js v14+

### Installation

```sh
npm install @clerk/clerk-react
```

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

To build the package in watch mode, run the following:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Clerk requires your application to be wrapped in the `<ClerkProvider/>` context.

If using Create React App, set `REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to your Publishable key in your `.env.local` file to make the environment variable accessible on `process.env` and pass it as the `publishableKey` prop.

```jsx
import { render } from 'react-dom';

import { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

const publishableKey = process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

render(
  <ClerkProvider publishableKey={publishableKey}>
    <App />
  </ClerkProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello Clerk!</h1>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton afterSignOutUrl={window.location.href} />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton mode='modal' />
      </SignedOut>
    </>
  );
}
```
