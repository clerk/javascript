## Overview

Clerk is the easiest way to add authentication and user management to your Remix application. Add sign up, sign in, and profile management to your application in minutes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Remix `^2.0.0` or later
- Node.js `>=18.18.0` or later

### Installation

```sh
npm install @clerk/remix
```

### Build

To build the package locally with the TypeScript compiler, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

To build the package in watch mode, run the following:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Make sure the following environment variables are set in a `.env` file:

```sh
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[publishable-key]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[backend-secret-key]
```

You can get these from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) screen in your Clerk dashboard.

To initialize Clerk with your Remix application, you will need to make three modifications to `app/root.jsx`:

1. Export `rootAuthLoader` as `loader`
2. Export `ClerkErrorBoundary` as `ErrorBoundary`
3. Wrap the default export with `ClerkApp`

```jsx
import { rootAuthLoader } from '@clerk/remix/ssr.server';
import { ClerkApp, ClerkErrorBoundary } from '@clerk/remix';

export const loader = args => rootAuthLoader(args);
export const ErrorBoundary = ClerkErrorBoundary();

function App() {
  return <html lang='en'>[...]</html>;
}

export default ClerkApp(App);
```

After those changes are made, you can use Clerk components in your routes.

For example, in `app/routes/index.jsx`:

```jsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/remix';

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        fontFamily: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
        lineHeight: '1.4',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h1>Hello Clerk!</h1>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton mode='modal' />
      </SignedOut>
    </div>
  );
}
```
