## 2.6.6

### Patch Changes

- ESM/CJS support for `@clerk/clerk-react` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  Changes that should affect users and OS contributors:

  - Better source map support for `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared`. This affects anyone developing in our monorepo or anyone using a debugger with Clerk installed in their app.
  - Easier node_modules debugging as `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/nextjs` are no longer getting bundled as a single-file package. This also improves error logging in nextjs a lot, as nextjs usually logs the line that threw the error - a minified, single-file package, usually consists of a very long single-line module, so logging error in NextJS wasn't ideal.
  - Headless clerk-js bundle size reduced by ~10kb, normal clerk-ks by ~6kb
  - A new `clerkJSVersion` prop has been added on ClerkProvider allowing to fetch a specific clerk-js version.

- Updated dependencies [[`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3), [`b66ea0a5`](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/commit/b66ea0a5aea0d6801e03a1426a0db69921b7b0e3)]:
