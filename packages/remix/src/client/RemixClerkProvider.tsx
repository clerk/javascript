/**
 * Remix hydration errors should not stop Clerk navigation from working, as the components mount only after
 * hydration is done (in the case of a hydration error, the components will simply mount after client-side hydration)
 * In the case of a hydration error, the first `navigate` function we get from the `useNavigate` hook will not work
 * because the RemixClerkProvider (which is part of the host app) will unmount before the following useEffect within `navigate` fires:
 * https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/packages/react-router/lib/hooks.tsx#L175
 * so isomorphicClerk will initialise with a `navigate` function that will never have `activeRef.current` set to true.
 * This variable is just an object ref/cache outside the React rendering cycle that holds a reference to the
 * latest `navigate` function. After a hydration error occurs, RemixClerkProvider will *remount* and this variable
 * will finally get a `navigate` function that has a `activeRef.current` to true so navigation will function as it should.
