# Change Log

## 5.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Add development mode warning in the browser console when `load()` happens. Companion PR for [Add dev mode warning to components](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3870). ([#3930](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3930)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

- Fix unresponsive behavior when clicking placeholder logo in the `<CreateOrganization />` component ([#3921](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3921)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)

- In certain situations the Frontend API response contains [`supported_first_factors`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/Sign-Ins#operation/createSignIn!c=200&path=response/supported_first_factors&t=response) with a `null` value while the current code always assumed to receive an array. `SignInResource['supportedFirstFactors']` has been updated to account for that and any code accessing this value has been made more resilient against `null` values. ([#3938](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3938)) by [@dstaley](https://github.com/dstaley)

- Updated dependencies [[`7e0ced3da`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/7e0ced3da94f41056bc4445d163d3b615afb6ab1), [`b6f0613dc`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/b6f0613dc9d8b0bab41cfabbaa8621b126e3bdf5)]:
  - @clerk/shared@2.5.1
  - @clerk/types@4.13.1
  - @clerk/localizations@2.5.8

## 5.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `nonce` to clerk-js' script loading options. Also adds a `nonce` prop to `ClerkProvider`. This can be used to thread a nonce value through to the clerk-js script load to support apps using a `strict-dynamic` content security policy. For next.js applications, the nonce will be automatically pulled from the CSP header and threaded through without needing any props so long as the provider is server-rendered. ([#3858](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3858)) by [@jescalan](https://github.com/jescalan)

- Introduce `transferable` prop for `<SignIn />` to disable the automatic transfer of a sign in attempt to a sign up attempt when attempting to sign in with a social provider when the account does not exist. Also adds a `transferable` option to `Clerk.handleRedirectCallback()` with the same functionality. ([#3845](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3845)) by [@BRKalow](https://github.com/BRKalow)

### Minor Changes

- Add `createOrganizationsLimit` param in `@clerk/backend` method `User.updateUser()` ([#3823](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3823)) by [@NicolasLopes7](https://github.com/NicolasLopes7)

  Example:

  ```typescript
      import { createClerkClient }  from '@clerk/backend';

      const clerkClient = createClerkClient({...});
      // Update user with createOrganizationsLimit equals 10
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser('user_...', { createOrganizationsLimit: 10 })

      await clerkClient.users.updateUser('user_...', { createOrganizationsLimit: 0 })
  ```

### Patch Changes

### Minor Changes

- Introducing a development mode warning when in development mode in order to mitigate going to production with development keys. ([#3870](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3870)) by [@octoper](https://github.com/octoper)

  In case need to deactivate this UI change temporarily to simulate how components will look in production, you can do so by adding the `unsafe_disableDevelopmentModeWarnings` layout appearance prop to `<ClerkProvider>`

  Example:

  ```tsx
  <ClerkProvider
    appearance={{
      layout: {
        unsafe_disableDevelopmentModeWarnings: true,
      },
    }}
  />

### Minor Changes

- Introduce support for custom menu items in `<UserButton/>`. ([#3784](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3784)) by [@nikospapcom](https://github.com/nikospapcom)

  - Use `<UserButton.MenuItems>` as a child component to wrap custom menu items.
  - Use `<UserButton.Link/>` for creating external or internal links.
  - Use `<UserButton.Action/>` for opening a specific custom page of "UserProfile" or to trigger your own custom logic via `onClick`.
  - If needed, reorder existing items like `manageAccount` and `signOut`

  New usage example:

  ```jsx
  <UserButton>
    <UserButton.MenuItems>
      <UserButton.Link label="Terms" labelIcon={<Icon />} href="/terms" />
      <UserButton.Action label="Help" labelIcon={<Icon />} open="help" /> //
      Navigate to `/help` page when UserProfile opens as a modal. (Requires a
      custom page to have been set in `/help`)
      <UserButton.Action label="manageAccount" labelIcon={<Icon />} />
      <UserButton.Action
        label="Chat Modal"

### Minor Changes

- Support reading / writing / removing suffixed/un-suffixed cookies from `@clerk/clerk-js` and `@clerk/backend`. by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

- In a previous release the protocol validation for window navigation was added ([ref](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/b91e0ef4036d215da09d144f85b0a5ef2afe6cba)). Since then only `http:` and `https:` were allowed. ([#3564](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3564)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

  - @clerk/shared@2.3.0

## 5.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add descriptor for formatted dates in tables. Those elements can be identified by the `cl-formattedDate__tableCell` css class. ([#3465](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3465)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

### Patch Changes

- In some instances your application logo (shown at the top of the sign-in/sign-up form of the prebuilt components) might have been distorted in browsers like Firefox. By applying `object-fit: contain` to the image's CSS the logo now fills its bounding box without being distorted. ([#3501](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3501)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

- Updated dependencies [[`ff31f7255`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/ff31f725541d82caaa9c13cf42cf15f8ce3992f4), [`8e5969d82`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/8e5969d82818c333d5459e5c70eb626d0968eb66), [`0e48fc210`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/0e48fc210cf0b5852052a21494a05f6e723101f5)]:
  - @clerk/shared@2.2.1
  - @clerk/localizations@2.4.3

## 5.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for GoogleOneTap. New APIs listed: ([#3392](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3392)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  ### React component

  - `<GoogleOneTap/>`

  Customize the UX of the prompt

  ```tsx
  <GoogleOneTap
    cancelOnTapOutside={false}
    itpSupport={false}
    fedCmSupport={false}
  />
  ```

  ### Use the component from with Vanilla JS

  - `Clerk.openGoogleOneTap(props: GoogleOneTapProps)`
  - `Clerk.closeGoogleOneTap()`

  ### Low level APIs for custom flows

  - `await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({ token: 'xxxx'})`
  - `await Clerk.handleGoogleOneTapCallback()`

  We recommend using this two methods together in order and let Clerk to perform the correct redirections.

  ```tsx
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    callback: async (response) => {
      const signInOrUp = await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({
        token: response.credential,
      });
      await Clerk.handleGoogleOneTapCallback(signInOrUp, {
        signInForceRedirectUrl: window.location.href,
      });
    },
  });
  ```

  In case you want to handle the redirection and session management yourself you can do so like this

  ```tsx
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    callback: async (response) => {
      const signInOrUp = await Clerk.authenticateWithGoogleOneTap({
        token: response.credential,
      });
      if (signInOrUp.status === "complete") {
        await Clerk.setActive({
          session: signInOrUp.createdSessionId,
        });
      }
    },
  });
  ```

- A bug was fixed to not override the existing sign-up state on the OAuth callback. ([#3401](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3401)) by [@LauraBeatris](https://github.com/LauraBeatris)

  When continuing a sign-up flow with social connections, `@clerk/clerk-js` was creating a new `SignUpResource` object, instead of patching the existing one.

  This was affecting Web3 sign-up flows, since the wallet ID was being overridden on the browser redirect.

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Updates related to experimental Google One Tap support ([#3250](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3250)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  - By default we are returning back to the location where the flow started.
    To accomplish that internally we will use the redirect_url query parameter to build the url.

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap />
  ```

  - In the above example if there is a SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL or SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL set then the developer would need to pass new values as props like this

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap
    signInForceRedirectUrl=""
    signUpForceRedirectUrl=""
  />
  ```

  - Let the developer configure the experience they want to offer. (All these values are true by default)

  ```tsx
  <__experimental_GoogleOneTap
    cancelOnTapOutside={false}
    itpSupport={false}
    fedCmSupport={false}
  />
  ```

  - Moved authenticateWithGoogleOneTap to Clerk singleton

  ```ts
  Clerk.__experimental_authenticateWithGoogleOneTap;
  ```

  - Created the handleGoogleOneTapCallback in Clerk singleton

  ```ts
  Clerk.__experimental_handleGoogleOneTapCallback;
  ```

- Introduce new `client_mismatch` verification status for email link sign-in and sign-up. This error (and its message) will be shown if a verification link was opened in another device/browser from which the user initiated the sign-in/sign-up attempt. This functionality needs to be enabled in the Clerk dashboard. ([#3367](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3367)) by [@mzhong9723](https://github.com/mzhong9723)

### Patch Changes

- Improve logging for CAPTCHA script loading errors ([#3374](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/3374)) by [@anagstef](https://github.com/anagstef)

- Respect the `signInForceRedirectUrl`, `signInFallbackRedirectUrl`, `signUpForceRedirectUrl` and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` props passed to `SignInButton`, `SignUpButton` and the low-level `window.Clerk.buildSignInUrl` & `window.Clerk.buildSignUpUrl` methods. These props allow you to control the redirect behavior of the `SignIn` and `SignUp` components. For more information, refer to the [Custom Redirects](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/custom-redirects) guide.

  ```ts
  // clerk.d.ts
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: "";
    role: "admin" | "basic_member" | "guest_member";

- d1b524ffb: Handle user_locked error encountered in an oauth flow by redirecting to /sign-up or /sign-in
- 12962bc58: Re-use common pagination types for consistency across types.

  Types introduced in `@clerk/types`:

  - `ClerkPaginationRequest` : describes pagination related props in request payload
  - `ClerkPaginatedResponse` : describes pagination related props in response body
  - `ClerkPaginationParams` : describes pagination related props in api client method params

- 2e4a43017: Update `@clerk/clerk-js` and `@clerk/clerk-react` to support the following examples:

  ```typescript
  Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/' })

  <SignOutButton redirectUrl='/' />
  // uses Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/' })
  <UserButton afterSignOutUrl='/after' />
  // uses Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/after' })
  <ClerkProvider afterSignOutUrl='/after' />
  // uses Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/after' })
  ```

- 5aab9f04a: Add `routerDebug` option in `Clerk.load()` to log the destination URLs when navigating
- 46040a2f3: Introduce Protect for authorization.
  Changes in public APIs:
  - Rename Gate to Protect
  - Support for permission checks. (Previously only roles could be used)
  - Remove the `experimental` tags and prefixes
  - Drop `some` from the `has` utility and Protect. Protect now accepts a `condition` prop where a function is expected with the `has` being exposed as the param.
  - Protect can now be used without required props. In this case behaves as `<SignedIn>`, if no authorization props are passed.
  - `has` will throw an error if neither `permission` or `role` is passed.
  - `auth().protect()` for Nextjs App Router. Allow per page protection in app router. This utility will automatically throw a 404 error if user is not authorized or authenticated.
    - inside a page or layout file it will render the nearest `not-found` component set by the developer
    - inside a route handler it will return empty response body with a 404 status code

- 18c0d015d: Pass environment into `sdkMetadata` in order to detect if production clerk-js is used by other sdks in dev mode. When it is log dev warning from clerk-js.

- 5471c7e8d: Move and export the following from @clerk/clerk-js and @clerk/nextjs to @clerk/shared: - `DEV_BROWSER_SSO_JWT_PARAMETER` - `DEV_BROWSER_JWT_MARKER` - `DEV_BROWSER_SSO_JWT_KEY` - `setDevBrowserJWTInURL` - `getDevBrowserJWTFromURL` - `getDevBrowserJWTFromResponse`
- 5d6937c9f: Use signInUrl from props / context / repo-level to construct a redirectUrl in sign-up from email-link flow.
- ebf9be77f: Allow users to authenticate with passkeys via the `<SignIn/>`.

## 5.0.0-alpha-v5.12

### Major Changes

- Path-based routing is now the default routing strategy if the `path` prop is filled. Additionally, if the `path` and `routing` props are not filled, an error will be thrown. ([#2338](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2338)) by [@octoper](https://github.com/octoper)

  ```jsx

  // Without path or routing props, an error with be thrown
  <UserProfile />
  <CreateOrganization />
  <OrganizationProfile />
  <SignIn />
  <SignUp />

  // Alternative #1
  <UserProfile path="/whatever"/>
  <CreateOrganization path="/whatever"/>
  <OrganizationProfile path="/whatever"/>
  <SignIn path="/whatever"/>
  <SignUp path="/whatever"/>

  // Alternative #2
  <UserProfile routing="hash_or_virtual"/>
  <CreateOrganization routing="hash_or_virtual"/>
  <OrganizationProfile routing="hash_or_virtual"/>
  <SignIn routing="hash_or_virtual"/>
  <SignUp routing="hash_or_virtual"/>
  ```

- Make the user name on <UserButton showName /> clickable, i.e. part of the button's trigger. ([#2411](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2411)) by [@marcelscruz](https://github.com/marcelscruz)

  This change inverts the positions of `cl-userButtonTrigger` and `cl-userButtonBox`, the latter now being a child of the former.

- Consolidate `afterSignOutOneUrl` & `afterSignOutAllUrl` to `afterSignOutUrl` and drop usage of Dashboard settings in ClerkJS components. The Dashboard settings should only apply to the Account Portal application. ([#2414](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2414)) by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

### Minor Changes

- Remove MembershipRole. The type `MembershipRole` would always include the old role keys `admin`, `basic_member`, `guest_member`. ([#2388](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2388)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  If developers still depend on them after the introduction of custom roles, the can provide them as their custom types for authorization.

  ```ts
  // clerk.d.ts
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: "";
    role: "admin" | "basic_member" | "guest_member";
  }
  ```

- Update `@clerk/clerk-js` and `@clerk/clerk-react` to support the following examples: ([#2412](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2412)) by [@dimkl](https://github.com/dimkl)

  ```typescript
  Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/' })

  <SignOutButton redirectUrl='/' />
  // uses Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/' })
  <UserButton afterSignOutUrl='/after' />
  // uses Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/after' })
  <ClerkProvider afterSignOutUrl='/after' />
  // uses Clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/after' })
  ```

### Patch Changes

  - @clerk/types@4.0.0-alpha-v5.12

## 5.0.0-alpha-v5.11

### Major Changes

- Remove hashing and third-party cookie functionality related to development instance session syncing in favor of URL-based session syncing with query parameters. ([#2367](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2367)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

- - `buildUrlWithAuth` no longer accepts an `options` argument. ([#2367](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2367)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

### Patch Changes

- Remove legacy roles fallback ([#2385](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2385)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  After the release of Custom Roles, roles should always be dynamically fetched.

  - @clerk/shared@2.0.0-alpha-v5.7

## 5.0.0-alpha-v5.10

### Major Changes

- Drop `redirectToHome` redirect method in favour of `redirectToAfterSignUp` or `redirectToAfterSignIn`. ([#2251](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2251)) by [@octoper](https://github.com/octoper)

  When the `<SignIn/>` and `<SignUp/>` components are rendered while a user is already logged in, they will now redirect to the configured `afterSignIn` and `afterSignUp` URLs, respectively. Previously, the redirect URL was set to the home URL configured in the dashboard.

### Minor Changes

- Introduce Protect for authorization. ([#2170](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2170)) by [@panteliselef](https://github.com/panteliselef)

  Changes in public APIs:

  - Rename Gate to Protect
  - Support for permission checks. (Previously only roles could be used)
  - Remove the `experimental` tags and prefixes
  - Drop `some` from the `has` utility and Protect. Protect now accepts a `condition` prop where a function is expected with the `has` being exposed as the param.
  - Protect can now be used without required props. In this case behaves as `<SignedIn>`, if no authorization props are passed.
  - `has` will throw an error if neither `permission` or `role` is passed.
  - `auth().protect()` for Nextjs App Router. Allow per page protection in app router. This utility will automatically throw a 404 error if user is not authorized or authenticated.
    - inside a page or layout file it will render the nearest `not-found` component set by the developer
    - inside a route handler it will return empty response body with a 404 status code

### Patch Changes

- Update `@zxcvbn-ts/core` from `2.2.1` to `3.0.4`. Update `@zxcvbn-ts/language-common` from `3.0.2` to `3.0.4`. ([#2326](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2326)) by [@LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts)

- Add `useAssertWrappedByClerkProvider` to internal code. If you use hooks like `useAuth` outside of the `<ClerkProvider />` context an error will be thrown. For example: ([#2299](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2299)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)

  ```shell
  @clerk/clerk-react: useAuth can only be used within the <ClerkProvider /> component
  ```

Custom pages can be created using the `<UserProfile.Page>` component, and external links can be added using the `<UserProfile.Link>` component. The default routes, such as `Account` and `Security`, can be reordered.

  Example React API usage:

  ```tsx
  <UserProfile>
    <UserProfile.Page
      label="Custom Page"
      url="custom"
      labelIcon={<CustomIcon />}
    >
      <MyCustomPageContent />
    </UserProfile.Page>
    <UserProfile.Link label="External" url="/home" labelIcon={<Icon />} />
    <UserProfile.Page label="account" />
    <UserProfile.Page label="security" />
  </UserProfile>
  ```

  Custom pages and links should be provided as children using the `<UserButton.UserProfilePage>` and `<UserButton.UserProfileLink>` components when using the `UserButton` component.

  The `<OrganizationProfile />` component now supports the addition of custom pages and external links to the navigation sidebar. Custom pages can be created using the `<OrganizationProfile.Page>` component, and external links can be added using the `<OrganizationProfile.Link>` component. The default routes, such as `Members` and `Settings`, can be reordered.

  Example React API usage:

  ```tsx
  <OrganizationProfile>
    <OrganizationProfile.Page
      label="Custom Page"
      url="custom"
      labelIcon={<CustomIcon />}
    >
      <MyCustomPageContent />
    </OrganizationProfile.Page>
    <OrganizationProfile.Link
      label="External"
      url="/home"
      labelIcon={<Icon />}
    />
    <OrganizationProfile.Page label="members" />
    <OrganizationProfile.Page label="settings" />
  </OrganizationProfile>
  ```

  Custom pages and links should be provided as children using the `<OrganizationSwitcher.OrganizationProfilePage>` and `<OrganizationSwitcher.OrganizationProfileLink>` components when using the `OrganizationSwitcher` component.

- Add missing appearance keys for the "Manage Organization" button within `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

### Patch Changes

- Make first name, last name & password readonly for users with active SAML accounts by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- Load CF turnstile from FAPI by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- ESM/CJS support for `@clerk/clerk-react` by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

  Changes that should affect users and OS contributors:

  - Better source map support for `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared`. This affects anyone developing in our monorepo or anyone using a debugger with Clerk installed in their app.
  - Easier node_modules debugging as `@clerk/clerk-react`, `@clerk/shared` and `@clerk/nextjs` are no longer getting bundled as a single-file package. This also improves error logging in nextjs a lot, as nextjs usually logs the line that threw the error - a minified, single-file package, usually consists of a very long single-line module, so logging error in NextJS wasn't ideal.
  - Headless clerk-js bundle size reduced by ~10kb, normal clerk-ks by ~6kb
  - A new `clerkJSVersion` prop has been added on ClerkProvider allowing to fetch a specific clerk-js version.

- Add support for dataURLs in User.setProfileImage by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)

- Support OTP autofill for Chrome on iOS by [@nikosdouvlis](https://github.com/nikosdouvlis)
