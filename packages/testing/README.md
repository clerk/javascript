## Overview

This package provides utilities for testing Clerk applications.

It currently supports the following testing frameworks:

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a Node.js library to automate browsers and web pages.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=18.17.0` or later
- Playwright v1+

### Installation

```shell
npm install @clerk/testing --save-dev
```

## Usage

### Playwright

Firstly, add your Clerk keys (`CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`) to your environment variables file (e.g. `.env.local` or `.env.`).
You can find these keys in your Clerk Dashboard.

All Playwright related utilities are exported from `@clerk/testing/playwright`. Make sure that your import paths are correct!

On your global setup file for Playwright, you must use the `clerkSetup` function to set up Clerk for your tests.

```typescript
// global-setup.ts
import { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/playwright';
import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test';

setup('global setup', async ({ }) => {
  await clerkSetup();
  ...
});
```

Then, you can use the `setupClerkTestingToken` function to bypass bot protection on your tests.

```typescript
// my-test.spec.ts
import { setupClerkTestingToken } from "@clerk/testing/playwright";
import { test } from "@playwright/test";

test("sign up", async ({ page }) => {
  await setupClerkTestingToken({ page });

  await page.goto("/sign-up");
  ...
});
```
