# As squash merging is enforced in this repository, we enforce conventional commits
# in the PR title, which is used as the commit message on merge, to ensure that the
# commit messages that make it into the main branch follow a standard format.
# This step is done in a separate workflow file so that we can trigger on the `edited` pull_request event type.
