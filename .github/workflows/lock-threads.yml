            Hello 👋

            In an effort to keep our GitHub issues clean and focused, we close any issues that are awaiting a reproduction after 8 days on inactivity, and it has been 7 days. This issue will be closed tomorrow unless a reproduction is provided. If it takes longer than this to get a reproduction, that's ok, just drop a comment and we will remove the Stale label.

            [How to create a minimal reproduction](https://clerkdev.notion.site/clerkdev/Creating-a-Minimal-Reproduction-0436afc4203f41aa9aa8700968aaef48)

            After 8 days without a reproduction being supplied, we are closing this issue. Keep in mind, I'm just a robot, so if I've closed this issue in error, please reply here and my human colleagues will reopen it. Likewise if a reproduction is prepared after it has been closed.
