An interface that describes the response of a method that returns a paginated list of resources.

> [!TIP]
> Clerk's SDKs always use `Promise<ClerkPaginatedResponse<T>>`. If the promise resolves, you will get back the properties. If the promise is rejected, you will receive a `ClerkAPIResponseError` or network error.
