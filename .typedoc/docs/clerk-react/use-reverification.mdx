> Depending on the SDK you're using, this feature requires `@clerk/nextjs@6.12.7` or later, `@clerk/clerk-react@5.25.1` or later, and `@clerk/clerk-js@5.57.1` or later.

The `useReverification()` hook is used to handle a session's reverification flow. If a request requires reverification, a modal will display, prompting the user to verify their credentials. Upon successful verification, the original request will automatically retry.

## Parameters

| Parameter  | Type      |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `fetcher`  | `Fetcher` |
| `options?` | `Options` |

## Returns

`UseReverificationResult`\<`Fetcher`\> â€” The `useReverification()` hook returns an array with the "enhanced" fetcher.

## Example

### Handle cancellation of the reverification process

The following example demonstrates how to handle scenarios where a user cancels the reverification flow, such as closing the modal, which might result in `myData` being `null`.

In the following example, `myFetcher` would be a function in your backend that fetches data from the route that requires reverification. See the [guide on how to require reverification](/docs/guides/reverification) for more information.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/components/MyButton.tsx' }}
import { useReverification } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import { isReverificationCancelledError } from "@clerk/clerk-react/error";

type MyData = {
  balance: number;
};

export function MyButton() {
  const fetchMyData = () =>
    fetch("/api/balance").then((res) => res.json() as Promise<MyData>);
  const enhancedFetcher = useReverification(fetchMyData);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    try {
      const myData = await enhancedFetcher();
      //     ^ is types as `MyData`
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error returned from the fetcher here

      // You can also handle cancellation with the following
      if (isReverificationCancelledError(err)) {
        // Handle the cancellation error here
      }
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Update User</button>;
}
```
