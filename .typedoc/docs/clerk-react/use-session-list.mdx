## Example

### Get a list of sessions

The following example uses `useSessionList()` to get a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `sessions` property is used to show the number of times the user has visited the page.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Home.tsx' }}
import { useSessionList } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome back. You've been here {sessions.length} times before.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
"use client";

import { useSessionList } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function HomePage() {
  const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome back. You've been here {sessions.length} times before.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
