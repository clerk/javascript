The `useSession()` hook provides access to the current user's [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) object, as well as helpers for setting the active session.

## Returns

This function returns a discriminated union type. There are multiple variants of this type available which you can select by clicking on one of the tabs.

<Tabs items={['Initialization', 'Signed out', 'Signed in']}>
<Tab>
| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `isLoaded` | `false` | A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads. |

## Example

### Access the `Session` object

The following example uses the `useSession()` hook to access the `Session` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property. The `lastActiveAt` property is a `Date` object used to show the time the session was last active.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Home.tsx' }}
import { useSession } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }
  if (!isSignedIn) {
    // Handle signed out state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        This session has been active since{" "}
        {session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString()}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
"use client";

import { useSession } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function HomePage() {
  const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }
  if (!isSignedIn) {
    // Handle signed out state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        This session has been active since{" "}
        {session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString()}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
