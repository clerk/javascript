The `useSignUp()` hook provides access to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-up-flow).

## Returns

This function returns a discriminated union type. There are multiple variants of this type available which you can select by clicking on one of the tabs.

<Tabs items={['Initialization', 'Loaded']}>
<Tab>
| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `isLoaded` | `false` | A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads. |
| `setActive` | `undefined` | A function that sets the active session. |
| `signUp` | `undefined` | An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. |
</Tab>
<Tab>
| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `isLoaded` | `true` | A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads. |
| `setActive()` | <code>([setActiveParams](/docs/references/javascript/types/set-active-params)) => Promise\<void\></code> | A function that sets the active session. |
| `signUp` | [`SignUpResource`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up) | An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. |

## Examples

### Check the current state of a sign-up

The following example uses the `useSignUp()` hook to access the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up) object, which contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx' }}
import { useSignUp } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function SignUpPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp?.status}.</div>;
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-up/page.tsx' }}
"use client";

import { useSignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function SignUpPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp?.status}.</div>;
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create a custom sign-up flow with `useSignUp()`

The `useSignUp()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-up flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-up flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignUp()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
