The Backend `PhoneNumber` object describes a phone number. Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users.

Phone numbers must be **verified** to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

Finally, phone numbers can be used as part of [multi-factor authentication](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication). During sign in, users can opt in to an extra verification step where they will receive an SMS message with a one-time code. This code must be entered to complete the sign in process.
